# Reinforced Glass Uses Glass

[**Factorio Mod Portal**](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/reinforced-glass-uses-glass)

Tiny recipe tweak that makes Maraxsis' reinforced glass use Moshine's glass
instead of sand because it bothered me that there were different glass types!
This mod does the following:

- Replace ingredient.name "sand" with "glass" and set ingredient.amount to
  whatever is configured as ingredient amount
- Regenerate recycler recipe (jankily) to reflect new recipe
- Optionally add glass recipe to Maraxsis' glassworking tech
