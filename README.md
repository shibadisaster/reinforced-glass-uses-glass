# Reinforced Glass Uses Glass

_Factorio Mod_ - Tiny recipe tweak that makes Maraxsis' reinforced glass use
Moshine's glass instead of sand because it bothered me that there were different
glass types! This mod does the following:

- Replace ingredient.name "sand" with "glass" and set ingredient.amount to
  whatever is configured as ingredient amount
- Regenerate recycler recipe (jankily) to reflect new recipe
- Optionally add glass recipe to Maraxsis' glassworking tech
